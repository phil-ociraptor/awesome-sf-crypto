# Contributing

You can always make a contribution by tagging Phil on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/philipliao_) or [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/philipliao)!

But if you are ready to make a PR? Please name your PR with the following convention:

```
[section] write a description starting with a verb
```

Example:

```
[organizations] add Noisebridge
```

Please keep your PRs short and focused. That means avoid adding many unrelated things at once.

Admins may do large changes where many things are done at once, but do not follow their example.
